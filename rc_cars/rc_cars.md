Racing radio controlled cars is a hobby of mine. I often get funny looks when I mention this, but I like cars, I like speed, I like technology, and this has all of those things!

I used to race before going to cégep (the Québec equivalent to college), which was, um, in 1993. I was pretty decent at it, won some local club championships, but it was on ovals, which is easier to pick up than the circuits they mostly run on here in the UK, almost everything changed (motor and battery technology we could only dream of!), and, well, it was over 20 years ago!

Now, I'm a newbie again, but having quite a bit of fun again, especially now that I'm not rebuilding ball diffs, truing motor comms, cleaning and filing brushes, conditioning Ni-Cad batteries, and so on. ;-)

Here's a few things I learned while getting back into this, might be useful to other newbies...

Motors
======

There's two types of motors, brushed and brushless. I won't go into much details on brushed motors, as they seem to be on their way to extinction... They are cheaper, but have more parts that wear out and need maintenance, and also have less power, everything else being equal. So they're typically used in cheaper ready-to-run (RTR) kits, that are more oriented toward "bashing" (running your car non-competitively, in a park or backyard). Bashing is fine, running non-competitively is great fun, but maintenance and parts wearing out, that's not fantastic. And we'd all like more power, yeah? So I'll just forget that brushed motors even exist, from now on, and if you have an extra £10 kicking around, I'd suggest you do too. ;-)

Motors are rated by the number of turns in their coils. The lower the number, the faster the motor. For some reason, brushless motors have "half turns", so they have ratings like 4.5T, 10.5T, 17.5T, and so on. Some "stock" racing classes will enforce a specific number of turns, usually 13.5T or 17.5T, to keep the speeds similar and easier to drive. So, check with your local club before buying a motor, to find out how many turns you should get.

There's also two variants of brushless motors: sensored or sensorless. Sensorless motors are a way to cut costs, as they can run a bit rougher, and do not offer the same tuning possibilities as sensored ones do (they unable to have "boost"). The important bit when getting your kit is that not all ESCs (electronic speed controllers, the component driving the motor) support sensored or sensorless motors, so make sure to match up both components! Many ESCs will support both, but not all, so ask your hobby shop if you're not sure.

One way to make sure you get this right is to buy a motor and ESC combo (possibly saving a bit of money too).

LiPo
====

Lithium polymer (LiPo) batteries are a similar technology to laptop batteries. When buying a LiPo pack, there are two things to pay attention to.

The first is the number of cells in the pack. For 1:10 and 1:12 scale racing, it's usually one or two cells. This is also sometimes called "1S" or "2S", the "S" referring to how the cells are in series (yeah, okay, "1S" really makes no sense, but I'm not the one making this up, sorry), which adds up the voltage (a LiPo cell is nominally 3.7 volts, so a 2S pack should give out about 7.4 volts). The number of cells is usually dictated by the racing class, so again, check with your local club before buying your packs.

The other is the capacity of the pack, usually rated in milliamps/hours. This number represents how much power you can draw from the pack, in such a way that you'll run out after exactly an hour. For more entry-level racing, the capacity of the pack simply doesn't matter that much, because entry-level classes have motors that draw less power, and racing heats last a fixed amount of time, usually short enough that you won't even come close to run out. Packs with more capacity, though, are heavier, so if you're racing, you might want to get the lower capacity packs. If you're just running your car for fun, with no time limit (as in races), you might prefer to just get the bigger pack for a longer run time. Also, if you run motors with fewer turns, or use "boost", this will use more power, and might want a bigger pack.

LiPo batteries have something of a reputation, as they are liable to **catch on fire** (!!!) when they overheat. That tends to only happen if they are over-charged (either with too much current, or for too long), if you're gentle with your batteries, you should be okay. The BRCA recommends using no more than what they call "1C", which is to say to charge at same amount of current as the amp/hour rating of the battery (which should thus take one hour for a full charge). Remember that **1 amp is 1,000 milliamps**, of course! Most batteries are rated in milliamps/hour, and chargers are usually labeled in amps, so if you have a 5,500mAh pack, you'd use 5.5A to charge. Finally, clubs will usually require that you use LiPo bags (which have some fire-proofing), which seems like a good idea, just in case...

BRCA
====

The [British Radio Car Association](http://www.brca.org/) (BRCA) is the governing body for R/C car racing in the UK. They have lists of clubs, make up the classes and rules, and membership with them will provide you with a liability insurance, in case of incidents. Clubs will most likely require you to become a member of the BRCA, but you're allowed to race three meetings before having to do so.

Facebook
========

It seems like a lot of the UK racers and clubs have presence on Facebook, using it for their communities. Here's some of the groups and pages I've found on Facebook:

 - [BRCA Touring Car Championship](https://www.facebook.com/groups/brcatcnationals/)

CentralBooking
==============

In the UK, a popular web site to find races and clubs is [CentralBooking](http://www.centralbooking.org/). It's a little bit difficult to navigate at times, I find, and it doesn't have *all* the races or *all* the clubs, but you can get an idea of what is going on near you.
