Facebook
========

It seems like a lot of the UK racers and clubs have presence on Facebook, using
it for their communities. Here's some of the groups and pages I've found on
Facebook:

- [BRCA Touring Car Championship](https://www.facebook.com/groups/brcatcnationals/)
- [Hertford Radio Car Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/337059326393117/)

CentralBooking
==============

In the UK, a popular web site to find races and clubs is
[CentralBooking](http://www.centralbooking.org/). It's a little bit difficult
to navigate at times, I find, and it doesn't have *all* the races or *all* the
clubs, but you can get an idea of what is going on near you.

News
====

- [Red RC](http://www.redrc.net/)
- [The RC Racer](http://www.thercracer.com/)
- [MSUK RC News](http://www.msuk-forum.co.uk/)
- [Radio Control Car Racer Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.triactivemedia.radiocontrolcarracer): RC Racer is a print magazine, but they have an app that is fairly nice on an Android tablet (not free, but there's a trial)

Forums
======

- [RC Tech](http://www.rctech.net/forum/): Mainly US-based forum, but a big community (so many people to answer questions!), and there's a good number of people from the UK.
- [MSUK RC Forum](http://www.msuk-forum.co.uk/index)
- [RC RaceChat](http://rcracechat.com/)
