Shops I Have Used
=================

- [Active Scale Models](http://www.activescalemodels.co.uk/)

I only used them in person, when they were at Rug Rucers, at the [Hertford
Radio Car Club](http://www.hertfordracing.co.uk/). The owner was very helpful,
and took the time to answer my questions, despite a busy racing day! Their web
site was being worked on at that time, though, so I haven't tried that yet.

- [Demon Products](http://demonpowerproducts.co.uk/)

Very racer oriented, and I believe the owner is a racer himself? The stock
seems to be a bit spottier, but I wouldn't be surprised if sending them a note
using their contact form could get you sorted with what you need. They have
free shipping on orders over £40.

- [GT12 Shop](http://gt12shop.co.uk/) (also known as [ModelCarRacer](http://modelcarracer.com/))

As their name indicates, they specialize in GT12. Great support, I had two of
an item in an order, but they put only one, I got in touch, and the missing one
was in the mail the next day, free shipping. They've started the shop not that
long ago, but are growing the business, so I'd expect it to get even better.
They tell me that anything that their online inventory is not 100% complete,
but that if it's related to GT12, they probably have it, or they can get it the
next day, just ask them! Their online system also doesn't tell you the tracking
number, but they gave it to me when I asked them. They do free shipping on
orders above £50.

Note that their other [ModelCarRacer](http://modelcarracer.com/) site does
**not** seem to have the same inventory!

- [MB Models](http://www.rccarshop.co.uk/)

This is where I got most of my initial kit from, chosen mainly because they had
most of what I was looking for, so I could make a single order to get
everything, instead of chasing the lowest price and piecing everything
together. It turned out pretty well, I had some questions that the owner
answered quickly by email, nice experience. They have free shipping on orders
over £50.

- [Modelsport UK](http://modelsport.co.uk/)

I only used them for my hauler bag, as they had the best price on it, it was
all as expected. Their site is nice, but as they don't carry the Xray kits that
I wanted, I didn't use them much.

- [Steve Webb Models](http://stevewebb.co.uk/) (also known as [Servo Shop](http://servoshop.co.uk/))

This shop seems to specialise in radios and servos, which is where I got mine.
They have a wide selection, and seem to have good prices (they had the cheapest
price on the Spektrum DX4R Pro I wanted, which is an expensive piece of the
kit!).

- [Wheelspin Models and Hobbies](http://www.wheelspinmodels.co.uk/)

One thing I like about this shop is that they have "shadow stock", where they
might not have something in stock, but know they can get it easily from their
suppliers. This is nice, because at most other shops, if there's one thing they
momentarily don't have, you have to come back later and place your order when
they have everything (and then, it might be another bit missing). Or you could
do a second order, but then you might miss out on free shipping. But with this
shop, they'll set aside your order as they gather it from suppliers, and ship
it together when it's all there.

Make sure to get an account before placing your order, though, because I found
out on my first order that if you don't, there doesn't seem to be any way to
get the tracking number for your order!?

 - [Zen-Racing](http://www.zen-racing.co.uk/)

Their selection is a bit limited, but they are distributors for a few brands
(among others, ARC, G-Force, Xenon, Spider Grip, Titan Blitz, BSI glue, and of
course, their own Zen-Racing), which they have good stock of. What they have is
of course centered around onroad racing (world champion Dave Spashett is on
staff there, possibly a co-owner I think?). They have free shipping on orders
above £50, (Royal Mail Signed For or UK Mail, depending on the size). They also
offer track-side delivery to many events, as they are very present, and have
been quite helpful with tips on how to use their products.

Shops I Did *Not* Use (Yet?)
============================

This is for my own reference, as I might want to use them.

- [CPD Racing](http://shop.cpdracing.co.uk/)
- [HobbyKing.com](http://www.hobbyking.co.uk/)

I think HobbyKing is based in Hong Kong? They appear to have warehouses in a
few countries, including the UK, but I've heard that depending on which
warehouse a given part is from, you might have to pay import tax on it,
separately (when you get it?)? Their site seems to indicate which warehouse
each part is available in, but if you order there, you should pay attention to
that to avoid surprises!

- [JE Models](http://jemodels.com/)
- [Model Car Racer](http://modelcarracer.com/)
- [MomentumRC](http://momentumrc.co.uk/): Mark Stiles' shop, so should be good for 1/12 scale.
- [Moss Models](http://www.mossrcmodels.co.uk/)
- [RC Dis.Co](http://www.rcdisco.com/): UK importers for Xray, they should be able to get all the parts?
- [RC ModelShop Direct](http://rcmodelshopdirect.com/)
- [SLD Models](http://www.sldmodels.co.uk/)
- [SMD Direct](http://www.smddirect.co.uk/): UK importers for a few brands, including Sanwa.
- [Yeovil Model Car Racing](http://www.ymcracing.co.uk/)
