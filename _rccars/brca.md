The [British Radio Car Association](http://www.brca.org/) (BRCA) is the
governing body for R/C car racing in the UK. They have lists of clubs, make up
the classes and rules, and membership with them will provide you with a
liability insurance, in case of incidents. Clubs will most likely require you
to become a member of the BRCA, but you're allowed to race three meetings
before having to do so.
