For a long time, I've been wanting a place to put things I would like to last some time, and remain accessible. I've finally sat down, and did something about it.

I use Twitter, Facebook, and other such services, but every so often, I think of something longer, or that I feel would be of long term interest. For the last five or six years, due to the secretive aspect of my work, this was rather limited, but after changing team (now back to working on open source code!), it has slowly come back to my mind, I've become frustrated enough with the lack of any good place for this, and decided to get one.

I tend to over-engineer these sorts of things, so I decided to back up a second, and take my own common advice: [YAGNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it), so don't overcomplicate things, but make sure it's fixable. So this is just a simple, statically generated site (using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)), with posts having clean URLs that show nothing of the implementation, so they should remain good for a long time.

I'm hosting on a [GitHub](https://github.com/) subdomain for now, but hopefully I'll pick out a domain of my own soon, and have a durable place of my own.
