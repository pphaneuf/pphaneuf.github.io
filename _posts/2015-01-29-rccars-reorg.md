Decided to move the RC cars part of the site to its own [GitHub
repo](https://github.com/pphaneuf/rccars), so it could have its own set of
posts, in addition to the articles. The link at the top should still take you
there, though!

This will let me do timely posts when I go to events and such, for example.

Yeah, it's just some fiddling about, but that's my website, so that's how it
is. ;-)
